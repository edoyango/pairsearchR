# dsearchR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dsearchR is to make a point-pair search algorithm available in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dsearchR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edoyango/pairsearchR")
```

## Usage

The `dsearchR` function takes a list of vector coordinates (of any dimension), and a cutoff distance, and finds the pairs whose distance between is within the cutoff.

```{r example}
library(dsearchR)
(points <- list(c(1,1), c(2,1), c(2,2), c(1,2)))
(cutoff <- 1.1)
dsearchR(points, cutoff)
```
